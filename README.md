## SQL Examples

In this SQL repository, I will continue adding new SQL examples that are useful for data analytics. The first part of each document contains the fabricated dataset for demonstration and the following second part contains the SQL syntax examples for data analytics.

The examples contain both standard SQL and PostgreSOL syntax. 

The types of SQL statement include the follows:

* `select` `from`
* `where` `and`
* `order by (asc or desc)`
* `group by`
* `having`  (used below group by)
* `case` `else` `end` `as`
* `inner join` and `left join`, `on`
* `date()`
* Statement for subquery
* Statistics such as `count`, `max`, `min`, `sum`, `avg`
