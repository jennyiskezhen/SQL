## SQL Examples

In this SQL repository, I will continue adding new SQL examples that are useful for data analytics. In some documents, the first part contains the fabricated dataset for demonstration and the following part contains the SQL querying examples. In others only SQL querying examples are shown.

The examples contain both standard SQL and PostgreSQL syntax. SQL queries are written and tested using SQLite Studio.

The types of SQL statement include the following:

* `create table`
* `select` `from`
* `where` `and`
* `order by (asc or desc)`
* `group by`
* `having`  (used below group by)
* `case` `else` `end` `as`
* `inner join` and `left join`, `on`
* `date()`
* Statement for subquery
* Statistics such as `count`, `max`, `min`, `sum`, `avg`
* `distinct`
* `where` `between` `and`
* `like` with `%` showing the matching scenarios
